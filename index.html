Also if you draw you get 1 point and if you lose you get nothing.In this sport ther are goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders and attackers. Normally, the attackers are the players that score the goals and the defenders mostly tackle the ball from the oppostitions team and the goalkeepers save the shots. You are only allowed to use their foot to shoot and pass the ball although, the goalkeeper is allowed to catch the ball with his hands if they are in their box.  .</p>
